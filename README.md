# Prince of Persia Trilogy Killer

## How to use

* In drop down select game that you will use this killer for.
* Hotkey is key that you will press to restart game quickly.
* SoT, WW and T2T are locations to your POPx.exe files (x is {"", "2", "3"}).
* Killer delay is there to prevent people with slower pc to not being able to start game in windowed mode because of various different reasons. Especially usefull if you plan on using dxwnd and sometimes when you restart game and it boots in fullscreen instead of windowed, if that's the case put delay higher.
* You can set the priority/affinity if needed and know what you are doing (for example, some tricks in WW are known to work more consistently with a particular priority/affinity).
* Launch via Steam option is needed for using certain steam features like Steam Input. It loses a few seconds on every launch since it doesn't skip the launcher animation. It's worth noting that you do not need to use it just because you have the Steam version of the game.
